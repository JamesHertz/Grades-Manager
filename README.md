# Grades-Manager

A mini database to keep me informed of what's happing on my school.

I've written a first version of this, using purely java and java serialization to store the data on the disk. But I eventually realized that is was a bad idea. So I am rewriting the whole code base but this time using Sqlite to store the data presistently. I am redesigning everything and trying to come up with a clean and simple solution.
