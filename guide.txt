TODO:
    X Refactor code [doing so]
    -> Solve problems interfaces :)
    -> Start supporting etcs and being able to calculate the average grade {
    final idea evaluation: evaluation have part of counts for part of the final grade
    also have composite evaluation which can have one or more sub-evaluation
     }
    // what about numbers to choose what is gonna be the final grade ??
    -> Define a way of specifying th formula 
    -> Get all grades
    -> Comment the whole code
By now:
        -> Get a list of the average grade for everyone
        -> Change something in the code
        -> Get all final grade [only]
